Project Description
This assignment explores fundamental concepts in neural networks and deep learning using TensorFlow. It consists of four main tasks that cover various aspects of working with tensors, loss functions, optimizers, and model training.

Tasks Overview
1. Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping
Create and manipulate tensors

Perform reshaping and transposing operations

Demonstrate broadcasting in TensorFlow

2. Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning
Implement and compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) losses

Analyze how changes in predictions affect loss values

Visualize loss functions using Matplotlib

3. Train a Model with Different Optimizers
Work with the MNIST dataset

Train models using Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizers

Compare and visualize training and validation accuracy trends

4. Train a Neural Network and Log to TensorBoard
Preprocess the MNIST dataset

Train a simple neural network with TensorBoard logging

Analyze loss and accuracy trends using TensorBoard

Implementation Details
Task 1: Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping

Key operations: tf.random.uniform(), tf.rank(), tf.shape(), tf.reshape(), tf.transpose()

Task 2: Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning

Implements MSE and CCE using TensorFlow's loss functions

Uses Matplotlib for visualizing loss comparisons

Task 3: Train a Model with Different Optimizers

Utilizes tf.keras to build and train models on MNIST data

Compares Adam and SGD optimizers using accuracy plots

Task 4: TensorBoard Logging

Implements a simple neural network with TensorBoard callbacks

Stores logs in "logs/fit/" directory for visualization
